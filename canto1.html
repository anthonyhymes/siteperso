CANTO 1: LIMBO
      </h1>
<p>
  Midway upon the journey of life, deep in a wood dark with fright,</p>
<p>
  Runs Steve Jobs alone, for three monsters chase him, blacker than the night.</p>
<p>
  Exhausted, giving up, falling, with knees bent, he calls from his back, </p>
  <p>    
“God, Why do you punish me? What are these monsters that me attack?”</p>

<p> In this moment, through the grass and snow, comes a sage soul, dressed in red.</p>
<p> He removes his hood fully but Jobs does not know him from his head.</p>

<p> “Jobs, I am here, to save you from this fear, you do not know my face,</p>
<p> “But I have been sent to find you, and take you away from this place,</p>

<p> “I was the first to put sound in an ear, to make a voice away,</p>
<p> Seem to be so very near. The world was forever changed that day.”</p>

<p> Jobs sees him with vehement disbelief. “Alexander Graham Bell?</p>
<p> “If my eyes are seeing you, I must be dreaming, or don’t feel well!</p>

<p> “It’s time for me to find my way home, or wake up from this nightmare,</p>
<p> “I will just take out my new iPhone 5, to save me from despair!”</p>

<p> Jobs removes the sleek built-in case, but screams when looking at his apps,</p>
<p> “Oh! What horror is this? What the hell happened to Google maps?”</p>

<p> The sage Bell takes his new phone from him, and looks at it in his hand,</p>
<p> “I like the first iPod, with its rotary dial, this is quite bland.”</p>

<p> “Quite bland? Have you lost your mind! This is a communications key!</p>
<p> “Unlike any other, with a bigger screen, light weight and 4G!</p>

<p> “You can use it to do whatever you want, anytime anywhere!”</p>
<p> Bell leans in closely to respond: “Jobs, that’s exactly why you’re here.”</p>

<p> Jobs cries painfully, “yes here, where is here? Please answer my query.</p>
<p> “And be quick about it, otherwise, I will simply ask Siri.”	</p>

<p> “You will meet Siri, in due time, but we must go on a long walk,</p>
<p> “First I will tell you something that will make it hard for you to talk.</p>

<p> “You are dead Steve Jobs, it is the real truth, you died not long ago,</p>
<p> “But your soul was not laid to rest, for the sins of Apple & Co.”</p>

<p> “The sins of Apple? Are you mad? Do tell me what sin might that be?</p>
<p> “Letting information free? Connecting the world continually?</p>

<p> “What about the iPod shuffle? iTunes Genius recommendation?</p>
<p> “Certainly those cool inventions deserve some congratulation!”</p>

<p> “You are mistaken thinking of your colorful past creations,</p>
<p> “For man is taking the punishment for your book of innovations.”</p>

<p> Unable to comprehend, Jobs follows without another word.</p>
<p> They speak no more until through the twisted branches screaming is heard.</p>

<p> “What is that? That great door punctuated by those giant statues?</p>
<p> “The heat that’s coming makes my soul melt down, it deflates my virtues”</p>

<p> “This is where our journey must begin,” said Alexander Graham Bell,</p>
<p> Reaching out his arm, “Before you stand the mighty Bill Gates of Hell.”</p>

<p> Jobs’ voice is snatched away by fierce wind that circles the two beings,</p>
<p> He hears a whiny voice, faces with glasses mocking his feelings.</p>

<p> He turns to Alexander Graham Bell as the Gates of Hell open,</p>
<p> Jobs manages to eke out “you’re coming with me Bell, I’m hopin?”</p>

<p> “Yes Jobs, I will come with you, and just so you will not be alone-”</p>
<p> Bell hands Jobs a colorful Nokia Lumia Windows Phone.</p>

<p> “No!” cries Jobs “I go into Hell, fine, but that crap for this inventor??”</p>	
<p>But signs above the door read: “Abandon all hope, those who enter.”</p>
