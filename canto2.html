CANTO 2: LUST
      </h1>
<p>
  The lofty and rusted Bill Gates of Hell close behind the oddball duo,</p>
<p>Of the inventors Alexander Graham Bell and Steve you-know-who.</p>

<p>Before their eyes towers a red monster bullman three times their height,</p>
<p>With a breath of fire, horns of steel and a long tail of iron might.</p>

<p>Bell speaks to the roar of the beast: “Minos we have a visitor here,</p>
<p>“He’s by my side, to learn the truth: the weight of his sins is not mere.”</p>

<p>The beast ejects flames of death from his scabbed nostrils, and scans the men.</p>
<p>“Humpf,” says Minos, “If you honored ‘warranties’ you’d be in heaven.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you fix an iPad screen? Why do I have to buy a new one?</p>
<p>“I got hooves! Of course I drop it! But Angry Birds is too much fun!”</p>

<p>“Do you have a smart cover?” Asks Jobs acting innocently “may--”</p>
<p>“Of course I don’t have a damn cover!” bellows Minos angrily:	</p>

<p>“If it’s supposed to have a cover, why doesn’t it come with it?” Minos exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Minos, dear Minotaur,” soothes Bell, “this is part of why Jobs is blamed,</p>

<p>“For his part in spreading false desire and leading our souls astray.”</p>
<p>Minos shrugs his strong shoulders and drags his curling tail from the way.</p>

<p>The pair of inventors head down the path, before Jobs cracks his beak,</p>
<p>“You know Apple doesn’t have big margins, so---” his voice is cut weak.</p>

<p>They see shades of sinners who subordinated reason to desire,</p>
<p>Whose souls are committed to forever seek in the hot hellfire.</p>

<p>Bell cups his hands around his mouth, and calls to the floating souls there.</p>
<p>Responding, a shade comes, with a sad face and hipster facial hair.</p>

<p>“Restless soul, who have presented your ghostly self to us,” starts Bell,</p>
<p>“Can you kindly explain to Steve Jobs why you are banished to hell?”</p>

<p>The shade heaves an icy sigh which chills Jobs in his skin, bones, and spine.</p>
<p>“I’m here,” says the shade, “because I got a flu from waiting in line.</p>

<p>“I always had to have the newest Apple gadget, just more more!</p>
<p>“But it was so cold, as I stood for days outside the Apple store.</p>

<p>“Who would have thought that the thing which would stop me from being alive,</p>
<p>“Would be the microscopic improvements made in the iPhone 5!”</p>

<p>The shade vanishes in the swirling tornado of souls twisted.</p>
<p>“It is fair Jobs, that these people here, in their deaths you assisted,”</p>

<p>The reverent Bell continues, “They are what is known as a Fanboy.”</p>
<p>“God I hate that term,” mumbles Jobs, “it’s such an offensive killjoy.”</p>

<p>“They are what they are thanks in part to you Jobs, you created them,</p>
<p>“Because you continuously addressed lives as one big problem.”</p>

<p>“I am no more their father than you the sower of their birth seeds,</p>
<p>“I did not create them, I created products, which solved real needs.”</p>

<p>“No,” refutes Bell “You built unnecessary things, for pleasure, fun.”</p>
<p>“Pleasure?” Says Jobs, “Final Cut? The Mac Pro? What about that one?”</p>

<p>“A few of your products were truly needed, then you made others,</p>
<p>“New versions, colors, slimmer, it’s a wonder why anyone bothers!”</p>

<p>Jobs goes red: “You, Bell, confuse what you speak of with simple progress,</p>
<p>“Moving forward technology, that’s all, nothing more, nothing less,</p>

<p>“And Apple will keep moving forward driven by needs of many!”</p>
<p>“If that is true,” checks Bell, “how do you explain the iPad Mini?”</p>

<p>With no response the truth descends over Jobs and his hopes, his head.</p>
<p>“Come Jobs, the second circle. Follow me where you are being led...”</p>
