CANTO 3: GLUTTONY
      </h1>
<p>
  The dark descent continues, the slick wet jagged path angles down,</p>
<p>There walk both Bell and Jobs under filthy rain burning red and brown,</p>

<p>Pouring in hard driving sheets of pain seeping stench in gaseous mist,</p>
<p>Something soft moves under their feet, and caustic words from there are hissed.</p>

<p>Jobs slowly looks down to find the stinking black muck in which he stands,</p>
<p>Is comprised of writhing souls tortured raw, with flailing arms and hands,</p>

<p>Which reach out from the sewage pool of rotten old status updates,</p>
<p>Of stale tweets, push notifications, and photos of tasty plates.</p>

<p>From the obscure dense fog barks Cerebus, a triple throated beast,</p>
<p>Who senses their physical presence near, and comes running to feast.</p>

<p>Bell picks up heaps of fecal Linkedin connection invitations,</p>
<p>And heaves them into the approaching dog's chomping mastications,</p>

<p>Filling the choking throats who slumps away, as they go on walking,</p>
<p>A blackened figure rises and addresses them quickly talking.</p>

<p>"Who are you, vial creature?" Begs a bold Jobs, eager to move past,</p>
<p>“You going to say that I’m responsible for your sorry ass?”</p>

<p>“I am dead, here in hell, because I could not control my desires.</p>
<p>“What started as limited pleasures, became what I required,</p>

<p>“Now I’m banished here, drowning in the alerts that I created,</p>
<p>“Force fed Groupon offers, happy birthday messages belated.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” Says Jobs, “You're not talking about Apple, but that Facebook thing,</p>
<p>“We at Apple don't do social media, you remember Ping?”</p>

<p>“He is here because his addiction to social apps took his life,</p>
<p>“Cutting out the real human parts of his existence like a knife,</p>

<p>“Eventually, he started using more and more social apps,</p>
<p>“Each message had at least four exclamation marks and was all caps,”</p>

<p>“Unable to keep their addiction from their daily behavior,</p>
<p>“They will be destined to live in Hell and never know their savior,”</p>

<p>While shaking his head calmly tells the sage Alexander Bell.</p>
<p>“You have still not explained that it is because of me he is in hell,”</p>

<p>Steve Jobs believes that he has Bell stumped, he even lets out a smirk.</p>
<p>“Jobs,” asks Bell “how do you think all of those communication things worked?</p>

<p>“They did not magically take over lives, they were enabled,</p>
<p>“Through the ubiquitous devices you gave the world uncabled.</p>

<p>“First there were text messages and emails and those little red dots,</p>
<p>“At the beginning there weren't too many, but soon there were lots,</p>

<p>“Distracting people from their lives and stealing away attention,</p>
<p>“Buzzing and beeping at each and every communication,</p>

<p>“It’s come so far, it's amazing that anyone can sleep at night!”</p>
<p>“At least it's a lot better than the damn blinking BlackBerry light,”</p>

<p>Says Jobs brashly, “people talk to each other, that's what you did too!</p>
<p>“How can you criticize me for doing the exact same as you?”</p>

<p>“Jobs, you’re self-centered, have you not noticed that I too am in Hell?</p>
<p>Bell scoffs and shouts angrily: “Why do you think I am here as well?</p>

<p>“You will learn, that we are responsible for more than what we see,</p>
<p>“We are also punished for our effects on the society.</p>

<p>“I‘m in Hell too for my sins, but what you did is far more severe,</p>
<p>“Which is why we still have quite a long way to go downwards from here…”</p>
