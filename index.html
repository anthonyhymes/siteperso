             I always bring an entrepreneurial spirit to every project whether I’m working with a newly-launched startup or one of the most established 
             companies in the world. I have a passion for crafting a business idea and helping to bring it to life, through honing pitches and business plans, 
             orchestrating joint ventures, and executing innovative marketing strategies to gain traction. On the flip side, I have developed key relationships 
             with major players to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Through my persistent, personable, value-driven approach to marketing, I’ve 
             helped companies large and small reach their audiences in new ways, whether it be mass media or targeted online video content. 
             Here are a few of the clients I’ve worked with:

       My career has centered around the unending creation of content including video interview series and written articles, 
          ghostwriting for CEOs, researching best practices to acquire new business, attracting attention via social media and 
          gaining new users through email. I have interviewed celebrities, the directors of the world’s top business schools, 
          and artists on the cutting edge of creativity. Millions of words later, and topics ranging from psychology to mobile 
          app analytics terminology, I take pride in the creation of value-based content.

         During my MBQ focused on e-business I brought together my passion for tech and languages and I learned how to code. 
          I can build a website from scratch and make it do fun things. The best thing to do is to check out some of the sites I’ve 
          made, like this one, this one, this one, and of course the one you’re looking at.

      My novice skills won’t win me any programming awards and I’m definitely not a designer, but I do have a strong understanding of 
        web development which puts me in a unique position to be able to work with both the business and programming side of the 
        equation when developing software products for business needs.

       My experience working in analytics for Disneyland has brought me into the trenches to witness the power of data. I use data 
           to identify website optimizations through AB testing, and I report on the performance of digital marketing campaigns. 
           But I went further. I taught myself the programming language R and I’m proficient in SQL to unlock the wealth of data 
           available on the web. And it’s not enough to analyze data, one of the key parts of a successful data analyst is being able 
           to communicate insights to non-technical people, and I have experience with data visualization platforms like Tableau.
