INTRODUCTION:
      </h1>
<p>
Dante was a visionary, leader, and often times an outcast, responsible for the start of the renaissance. When he wrote the “Divine Comedy” in vernacular Italian, he broke the class system that kept knowledge -- always written in latin, a language which no common people spoke in 1300 -- a privilege of the few. He modernized thought. 
      </p>
      <p>
To present the journey through the levels of hell, Dante calls on his predecessor, Virgil, who wrote of the legend of Rome and the start of the Christian European cultural epoch we still live in today. Virgil leads Dante through hell, and explains the people and punishments. He helps Dante navigate the demons, burning rivers, and raging souls throughout the Inferno.  
      </p>
      <p>
The internet is the second renaissance, freeing information to everyone everywhere. Just like Dante, Steve Jobs is as responsible as anyone for the technological revolution: the breakdown of old communications systems, the worldwide advancement of information. The amount of good that technology, and particularly the internet, has done is  impossible to quantify. But technology fundamentally changes us, on emotional, psychological, and even physical levels. “iNFERNO” serves as a warning, a critical take on the effects of technology and the ambitious path that Apple blazes. 
</p>
      <p>
Instead of Virgil leading Steve Jobs, it’s the man who changed what it meant to communicate and started the “connected” era which continues until today. Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone enabled everything that came after: eventually the internet and the devices that connect to it. Together, the duo descend the levels of hell witnessing the punishments for Lust, Greed, Heresy, and Treachery until they meet Satan and the surprising, yet appropriate, ending. 
      </p>
      <p>
Originally published in the counter-culture, print-only “Can’t Understand New Technology,” “iNFERNO” blends humor and classic literature to critique the direction our society is going, satirizing the idolatry that we give to Steve Jobs and his precious fruit of knowledge.
