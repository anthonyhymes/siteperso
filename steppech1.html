  Chapter 1
  </h1>
  <br />  

  <p>
   The shudder of his horse's back legs grew stronger in his saddle. His body pitched side to side, 
   further and wider like an accelerating metronome atop a piano being rattled by an earthquake. The 
   blood had crusted his shirt to his side and the cracks in the scabs pulled at the open part of his wound. 
  </p>
  <p>
  A hole in the hard, frozen ground and the horse stumbled sending his head down on a collision course with the 
  equine skull. He rallied the reigns. The horse slowed by did not stop. With his good arm he slapped the horse 
  on the behind and dug his heels into its ribs. Laboring under his last strength the horse lunged across the flatland 
  and dropped to its knees. The frozen dirt scraped the skin from its shins. 
  </p>
  <p>
  He leapt down off the horse as it laid its head on the ground. The vapors of its last breaths dissipated into nothing. 
  He looked around himself, north, east, west, south. Nothing but the vastness of the Central Asian steppe. And a tree. One tree. 
  <p>
  His horse had fallen on his blood soaked sack. He leaned against the beast but it wouldn’t budge. Its breath came intermittently. 
  He pulled out his knife and stabbed it into the horse. A slight shudder resonated in the beast but it was not enough to move it. 
    The horse was resigned to death. </p>
  <p>
  Standing he surveyed in the direction from which he came. The wind whipped cold around his face. A few dry ice flakes journeyed 
  around his body. He could see no one. Stooping down he set to work cutting the horse open. He ripped out a chunk of its haunches 
    and tried to free his sack. The horse grew cold with the air. Solid grey clouds stretched from horizon to horizon. </p>
  <p>
  His knife cut down and hit the sack. He sat on the ground and put his legs against the horse’s back and pulled until the sack broke 
  free, ripping open and spilling its load of jade across the chunks of horse muscle and skin. The rare green gems soaked in the 
    darkness of congealing horse blood. He scooped up the pieces and took off towards the tree. </p>
  <p>
  Every step caused the wound in his side to open. He bit his chapped lips. The cold ground crept through his shoes. Soon his feet were 
  numb to the small sharp rocks and the dried bits of grass that cut shreds of cloth from his soles. The wind bore down on his hunched 
    frame and riled the dark hair that emerged from the corners of his hood. </p>
<p>
He paused for a moment and looked behind himself. Still no one. In front of him the tree has grown bigger, his only chance, 
  the fractal, empty branches of brown likes roots in the clouds. He pulled his scarf from his neck and ripped it into two long 
  lengths of cloth. He opened his cloak and peeled his shirt from the crusting blood of his wound. Black bile seeped from the cracks. 
  He took his length of scarf, tied it around himself, and pulled it taught. The wound tore at his entire body and he dropped to his 
  knees. </p>
<p>
Tying the cloth into a knot he closed his cloak. A few dry snowflakes whipped his red cheeks. He rose to his feet and continued forward. 
  The horizon was blurring, the gray steppe blended into the gray clouds and the world seemed infinite. He longed for warmth. He knew he 
  would never get it.</p>
<p>
There was warmth in the camp. There was warmth in the tent. There was warmth in the arms of the woman holding her child whose throat 
  he had slit to keep her from crying out. There was warmth in the blood on his hands as he laid her down silently before removing 
  the jade from its ornate box. Even the jade was warm. </p>
<p>
Now the jade was frigid and getting heavier with each step. His fingers were stiff from the cold, his joints locked around the 
  precious stones. The horse blood had hardened and he scraped it off with his long fingernails. The tree was taller now, and he 
  could make out the contrast of the jagged bark. </p>
<p>
His wound occupied a larger part of his mind. That brave boy, trying to protect his mother. He died a valiant death. Now his body 
  would be burned and his ashes carried by the wind across the steppe all the way to the Gobi, to be forgotten forever. </p>
<p>
When he got to the tree he collapsed against it. He unpeeled his fingers from the jade and ripped another piece of his cloth from his 
  scarf. Peering up at the branches of the tree he longed for summertime, for the leaves of the tree to protect him from the strong sun. 
  There were no leaves now. He was exposed. </p>
<p>
There was no choice, he raised himself up into the delicated branches which creaked but held under his light weight. He rose to the 
  middle of the tree and looked back across the horizon. There were two of them, on horses. Now four. Now six. They would reach the 
  horse soon. </p>
<p>
He took out his knife and chopped into the trunk of the tree, hacking until he had opened a small hole. He took out the jade wrapped 
  in cloth and stared at it. All of this death, including his own, for a few pieces of green gems. </p>
<p>
He looked across the horizon for any sign of hope. There was nothing and no one except for the six soldiers that rode steadily in 
  his direction. They would see him soon. He jammed the jade into the hole in the tree. He reached above his head and continued to 
  climb to the highest branches that would hold his weight. His wound burned. He closed his eyes and let go of the tree. </p>
<p>
His fall was broken by the branches and he hit the ground with a hard thud. The world browned but did not reach black. He gasped for 
  breath as his broken ribs stabbed into his lungs. He tried to roll over but his arm was broken. His face was stuck with rocks and 
  bits of roots. He turned his legs and cried out in pain. His pelvis was shattered. The pain come from everywhere. He laid still 
  on the ground. Death would not be as easy for him as it had been for the boy or his mother. He labored to get air into his lungs. 
  The ground trembled under his ear. The tremble grew louder and louder, and then it stopped. </p>
<p>
He could smell the horses but he couldn’t see the men. He heard one soldier dismount. Then two, then all of them. A face dipped 
  down into his field of vision. </p>
<p>
“He’s alive,” the soldier announced. Another reached down and picked him up. His body folded in half, the structure of his bones 
  providing no resistance. The soldier tried to prop him up against the tree but his body slid down. The pain had gone numb. 
  There was no longer the horizon, no longer the sky, no longer the tree. There was only the physical manifestation of consequence. </p>
<p>
“You will give us the jade.” The soldier stood immobile against the darkening clouds of the evening sky that streamed silently 
  above the flatland. </p>
<p>
The silence lengthened until he felt the blunt end of a spear press into his side, causing him to bend in half until his head was 
  again on the ground. A soldier’s hand reached down and took his jaw. It swung open and three broken teeth fell out onto the 
  frozen ground. He weakly spit a clot of dry blood that stuck to his chapped lip. </p>
<p>
Lying on the ground he wished that they would just leave him to die. Seeing his teeth a few inches in front of his face stuck 
  in the razor sharp frozen grasses was like witnessing the depart of his soul, broken blackened pieces that were to forever 
  lay dormant on the steppe, a precursor to the bones of his skeleton. </p>
<p>
“Search him,” the immobile soldier responded. Hands prodded through his rags of clothing, each finger a stinging tentacle that 
  poisoned his body with pain. Lifted off the ground a soldier ripped off his cloak and his pants. The cold wind numbed him in 
  soothing relief, until he was dropped and fell into a crumpled mass on the ground. The immobile soldier raised a hand. </p>
<p>
“Stand up,” the soldier commanded. He couldn’t move, his arms were pinned under his abdomen which was hunched over his knees. 
  He closed his eyes are tried to fight his way towards sleep or death. He clenched his jaws until the sound rose in his ears, 
  the vibration of desperation. Darkness was present, he could see it among the blasts of color that splashed over the back of 
  his eyelids. But the darkness would not come closer. The end of the spear touched his chest under his neck. It was the sharp end. 
  The cold blade burned his exposed skin. </p>
<p>
  “Get up.” </p>
<p>
He trembled at the blade. Fear of death induced a panic in him which was only manifested in the increased breathing that caused 
  pain to shoot from his broken ribs. The soldier started to pull the blade across his chest and he could feel the blood dripping 
  out of the gash. He wanted tears to come, to beg for any sort of mercy, but he could only cough and jam his remaining teeth into 
  his raw gums. </p>
<p>
  “Stop, stop” another soldier said. “That’s enough. He cannot move, the King wants him alive.” </p>
<p>
“If he truly cannot move, how did he get so far from the horse?” The soldier’s eyes rose above to the tree with its thin, 
  sickly branches. </p>
<p>
The ground rumbled with the sound of approaching hooves. His body was shivering uncontrollably, each rattle loosening his 
  remaining teeth. He did not know how many soldiers there were, but at least a few horses arrived and stopped within feet 
  of his head. A soldier jumped down and he could see the strong, warm shoes and he wanted to shrink down and wiggle inside 
  of them, between the toes of the soldier, a warm place. </p>
 <p>
   The new soldier lowered the scarf from his face. “We looked everywhere. No jade,” the new soldier said. </p>
<p>
  “And on the trail?” </p>
<p>
  “We followed his tracks. There is no jade.” </p>
<p>
  The immobile soldier stood looking at the tree. “You,” he indicated to another soldier, “climb the tree.” </p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.” The soldier went towards the tree and leaned his spear against the thin trunk. The lowest branch was just 
  within his reach. The soldier grasped the smoothed wood and tried to lift himself but the branch bent downwards until 
  it snapped releasing a crack that was immediately carried away to the west by the howling Siberian wind. </p>
<p>
  “Help him.” </p>
<p>
Another soldier pushed the first soldier up into the branches. The soldier clung to the central trunk and gingerly 
  tested his weight on the following branches. The immobile soldier looked down at the crumpled prisoner at his feet. 
  He was small, and appeared tiny now that he was compacted. The immobile soldier put his foot under the stomach of the 
  thief and rolled him over onto his back. He was clearly a boy. His lips had gone blue and his shivering was gentler. 
  Life was leaving his slender body. He had spilled blood, no matter what his age, he was a man now. His eyes stared 
  vacantly into the darkening clouds that raced above their heads. </p>
<p>
A branch cracked and the soldier came crashing down to the hard ground. His armor had broken his fall but he was still 
  slow to roll over. The immobile soldier took a blanket from his saddle and held it in the air above the eyes of the thief. 
  The soldier could see the eyes focusing on it. </p>
<p>
  “Tell me the truth, and I will give you this blanket.” A minor increase in the shudder confirmed his suspicions, the boy could listen. </p>
<p>
“You fell out of the tree.” The soldier waited for a response. “Is the jade in the tree?” The boy thought of his parents, his people, 
  his family. A soft melody sounded in his ears. It was the hymn of duty. With the rest of his remaining strength he blinked. </p>
<p>
  “No?” The soldier asked. </p>
<p>
  “Then why did he fall out of the tree?” Another soldier asked. </p>
<p>
The immobile soldier peered at the delicate form of the tree. “He knew we were coming, he knew there was no escape. 
  He tried to kill himself.” The boy’s eyes closed and world became heavy. The cold was cut and his breath circled 
  back to his face, slightly warming his cheeks and his red nose. He opened his eyes and the world was dark. He 
  felt two hands reach underneath him. </p>
<p>
  He could hear voices. “It will be a slow and painful death. Leave him here to die in the cold.” </p>
<p>
A voice resonated from above his face, the vibrations of speech sending crashing waves through his crippled body. 
  He was aware of the blanket that wrapped him, aware of the soldier holding him, and aware of the words that stuck 
  like daggers into his ears: “That is not what the King wants. We will take him to the camp, and he will pay for 
  killing the young Prince and the Queen.”</p>
